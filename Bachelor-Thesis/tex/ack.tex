\begin{thanks}
I would like to thank Prof. Yong Yu and Prof. Weinan Zhang for their valuable 
suggestions and guidance. Without their supports and instructions, this work can never be done.

And I thank Kan Ren, the senior PhD student of the APEX Lab who helped me a lot and gave lots of 
informative advice to this paper. And he also helps me a lot during my research life since I joined APEX Lab two years ago.

I would like to thank my girl friend, Yue Hu, who spent four years of long-distance relationship with me and gave
me lots of encouragement and solace during my life in SJTU.

Thanks to Shanghai Jiao Tong University and all the good friends I met here. I trully learnt a lot from
my life here.
\end{thanks}
