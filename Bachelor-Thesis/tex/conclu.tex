\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we propose \score, a model that utilizes sequences of incremental user-item interaction graphs and take a dual view from both view of the target user and item, to tackle the sequential recommendation task. We propose \textit{Co-Attention Graph Network} to aggregate multi-hop spatial information on the local graphs in a collaborative manner and \textit{Interactive Attention Mechanism} to model the dual sequences of user/item temporal dynamics with their interactive relationship.

For the future work, we plan to further investigate on the time segmentation strategy of the incremental graphs and its influence to the recommendation performance. We also plan to deployed our method on the real-world recommender systems.
